Hey, I'm Erik, and for over 18 years, I have been designing and implementing innovative solutions to challenging problems. I have held several technical leadership positions throughout my career, including eight years of leading the R&D department at [**uMake**](https://www.umake.com), an award-winning 3D design app. Presently, I am working at [**Wilco**](https://trywilco.com), where I have the opportunity to help software engineers all around the globe enhance their technical skills and become better professionals.

One of my passions is mentoring and guiding other engineers as they advance in their careers. Whether it's offering advice on technical issues, professional development, or job searching, I thoroughly enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others. If you're seeking mentorship in any of these areas, feel free to schedule a meeting with me through [**Calendly**](https://calendly.com/eriksapir/mentoring?month=2023-03).

I live in Tel Aviv with my partner Amit, our children Rony and Noga, and our furry companion Nili. When I'm not working, you can find me climbing, cooking, enjoying a cold beer with friends, and spending quality time with my family.
